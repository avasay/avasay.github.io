# Hello World!

Hi, my name is Alejandrio. Yes, I do want to say Hello World! Because this is my first development website. In fact, this is my very first website. I have been wanting to create my own development website for a very long time so I can share my development journey with y'all. It took me a while because I couldn't decide on the blogging platform or if I should pay for a hosting company. I decided to go with **Github Pages** when I saw someone's blog site by accident when doing online research for a work project. 

Basically, I want a place to share my development journey - share snippets of codes that helped me with projects at work. I want to share some technical know-how of how I solved programming issues in my projects. These are mostly **.NET** and **C#** stuff, and of course, a little bit of everything else. 

So... Let's do this!
