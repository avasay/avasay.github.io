# About Me

I am Alejandrio Vasay. I am currently a Web Developer for Tarrant County College in Fort Worth, Texas. I am mostly a .NET / C# / SQL programmer developing backend apps for our [college's website][tccd-site]. 

I have about 10+ years of full stack development experience in HTML, JavaScript, CSS, XML, XSLT, C#, ASP.NET, C++, SQL, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, and REST. Knowledge of Python framework Django, and Node.js framework Angular. Knowledge of Ruby, Jekyll, YAML, Markdown, and Linux.

I have a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science degree from Ohio University in Athens, Ohio. I have a Master of Computer Science degree from Texas A&M University in College Station, Texas.

I have worked for Sapient Corporation in Cambridge Massachusetts, Diebold in Athens Ohio, VitaminShoppe in San Diego California (not as a programmer), and Tarrant County College. I have interned at AT&T in Irving, Texas.

**Interesting fact**: My C++ professor at Texas A&M was Dr. Bjarne Stroustrup.
